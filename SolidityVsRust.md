## 📊 Blockchain Networks Comparison

### Solidity: The Ethereum King
```
Ethereum Mainnet
├── Layer 2s: Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism
├── Sidechains: BSC, Avalanche C-Chain
└── Testnets: Sepolia, Goerli

🎯 Strength: Mature ecosystem with $400B+ in TVL
⚠️ Limitation: High gas fees, ~15 TPS
```

### Rust: The Multi-Chain Champion
```
Solana (🚀 Hottest)
├── ~65,000 TPS
├── Fees: $0.00025 per transaction
└── Ecosystem: Jupiter, Magic Eden, Phantom

NEAR Protocol
├── Native sharding
├── JavaScript-friendly
└── Aurora (EVM compatible)

Polkadot/Substrate
├── Customizable parachains
├── Native cross-chain
└── Enterprise focus
```

## 🔧 Technical Comparison

### Smart Contract Architecture

#### Solidity (EVM-based)
```solidity
contract SimpleToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
```
**Features:**
- ✅ Familiar syntax (JavaScript-like)
- ✅ Extensive documentation
- ❌ Limited to EVM
- ❌ Gas fees can be prohibitive

#### Rust (Solana/Anchor)
```rust
#[program]
pub mod simple_token {
    use super::*;
    
    pub fn transfer(
        ctx: Context<Transfer>,
        amount: u64
    ) -> Result<()> {
        let from = &mut ctx.accounts.from;
        let to = &mut ctx.accounts.to;
        
        require!(from.balance >= amount, CustomError::InsufficientFunds);
        
        from.balance -= amount;
        to.balance += amount;
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```
**Features:**
- ✅ Superior performance (no VM)
- ✅ Memory safety + Zero-cost abstractions
- ✅ Compile-time error catching
- ❌ Steep learning curve
